# Evaluating SSNP

This is the repository containing the source code for the paper titled "Evaluating Architectures and Hyperparameters of Self-supervised Network Projections", by T. Cech, D. Atzberger, W. Scheibel, R. Richter, and J. DÃ¶llner, presented at IVAPP 2023.

Based on the source code for the paper titled "Self-supervised Dimensionality Reduction with Neural Networks and Pseudo-labeling" by M. Espadoto, N. S. T. Hirata, and A. C. Telea presented at IVAPP 2021 that is hosted at https://github.com/mespadoto/ssnp and

on the source code for the paper titled "SDR-NNP: Sharpened Dimensionality Reduction with Neural Networks" by Y.Kim, M. Espadoto, S. C. Trager, J. B. T. M. Roerdink, and A. C. Telea presented at IVAPP 2022 that is hosted at https://github.com/youngjookim/sdr-nnp.

# Experiments

`code_ssnp/experiment1_direct.py` was used for performing the first experiment concerning the optimization of training-related hyperparameters and
`code_ssnp/experiment11_modelarch.py` was used for performing the second experiment concerning the model architecture.
See the paper for details.
